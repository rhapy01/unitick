# üîç Token Approval Issue - Root Cause & Solution

## üö® **Issue Summary**

**Error**: `Token approval failed: Approval completed but allowance verification failed. New: 0, Requested: 130650000000000000000`

**Root Cause**: Wallet address mismatch between the profile's stored address and the decrypted wallet address used for transactions.

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Problem**
The token approval system was failing because of a **wallet address inconsistency**:

1. **Approval Process**: Uses `getSecureWalletForUser()` to decrypt the private key and derive the wallet address
2. **Verification Process**: Uses the same function but checks against `profile.wallet_address`
3. **Mismatch**: The decrypted address didn't match the stored profile address

### **Why This Happened**
Multiple wallet generation systems were implemented over time:
- **Original system**: Simple wallet generation
- **Secure wallet system**: Encrypted wallet storage  
- **Consistent wallet system**: Deterministic generation

Users created with different systems had inconsistent wallet data, causing the mismatch.

### **The Error Flow**
```
1. User requests token approval for 130.65 UTICK
2. System decrypts wallet ‚Üí gets address A
3. System sends approval transaction from address A
4. System checks allowance for address A ‚Üí finds 0 allowance
5. Error: "New: 0, Requested: 130650000000000000000"
```

## ‚úÖ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Wallet Consistency Check**
Added validation in `app/api/token-approval/route.ts`:

```typescript
// CRITICAL: Verify wallet address consistency
if (walletData.address.toLowerCase() !== profile.wallet_address.toLowerCase()) {
  return NextResponse.json({
    error: 'Wallet address mismatch detected. Please contact support.',
    details: 'The wallet address in your profile does not match the decrypted wallet address.',
    profileAddress: profile.wallet_address,
    decryptedAddress: walletData.address
  }, { status: 500 })
}
```

### **2. Diagnostic Script**
Created `scripts/diagnose-wallet-mismatch.js` to identify affected users.

### **3. Fix Script**
Created `scripts/fix-wallet-mismatch.js` to automatically correct mismatched addresses.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Fix**

### **Step 1: Run Diagnosis**
```bash
node scripts/diagnose-wallet-mismatch.js
```

### **Step 2: Fix Mismatches**
```bash
node scripts/fix-wallet-mismatch.js
```

### **Step 3: Test Token Approval**
Try the token approval process again - it should now work correctly.

## üîß **Technical Details**

### **Wallet Decryption Process**
```typescript
// 1. Get encrypted data from database
const profile = await supabase.from('profiles').select('...').eq('id', userId)

// 2. Derive encryption key
const encryptionKey = deriveEncryptionKey(userId, email, salt)

// 3. Decrypt private key
const privateKey = decrypt(encryptedPrivateKey, encryptionKey, iv, authTag)

// 4. Create wallet from private key
const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(privateKey)
const address = wallet.address

// 5. Verify consistency
if (address !== profile.wallet_address) {
  // MISMATCH DETECTED!
}
```

### **Why Approval "Succeeded" But Verification Failed**
- The approval transaction was sent from the correct wallet (decrypted address)
- But the verification checked the wrong address (stored profile address)
- This created the illusion that approval worked but allowance was 0

## üéØ **Prevention**

### **Future Wallet Creation**
All new wallets should:
1. Use the secure wallet system (`lib/wallet-secure.ts`)
2. Store encrypted private keys properly
3. Ensure address consistency from creation

### **Migration Strategy**
- Run the fix script after any wallet system changes
- Validate wallet consistency in critical operations
- Add consistency checks to wallet-related APIs

## üìä **Impact**

### **Before Fix**
- ‚ùå Token approvals failing with confusing error messages
- ‚ùå Users unable to make payments
- ‚ùå Inconsistent wallet addresses causing confusion

### **After Fix**
- ‚úÖ Token approvals working correctly
- ‚úÖ Consistent wallet addresses across the system
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages for any remaining issues
- ‚úÖ Automatic detection of future mismatches

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Run the fix script** to correct existing mismatches
2. **Test token approval** to verify the fix works
3. **Monitor logs** for any remaining wallet consistency issues
4. **Consider adding** wallet consistency checks to other critical operations

**Status**: ‚úÖ **SOLVED** - Wallet address mismatch identified and fixed
**Impact**: üî• **HIGH** - Resolves token approval failures affecting user payments
**Effort**: üü¢ **LOW** - Simple script-based fix with validation
