# Free Ticket Support in UniTick

## Overview

The UniTick platform now supports **free tickets** - tickets that can be issued without any payment required. This is essential for promotional events, free workshops, complimentary services, and other scenarios where vendors want to offer services at no cost.

## Smart Contract Changes

### UnilaBook Contract Updates

The `UnilaBook.sol` contract has been updated to support free tickets:

#### Key Changes:
1. **Amount Validation**: Changed from `amount > 0` to `amount >= 0` to allow zero payments
2. **Conditional Token Transfers**: Only transfer tokens when `amount > 0`
3. **Free Ticket Events**: Added `FreeTicketCreated` event for tracking free tickets
4. **Free Ticket Detection**: Added `isFreeTicket()` function to check if a ticket is free

#### New Functions:
```solidity
function isFreeTicket(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (bool)
```

#### New Events:
```solidity
event FreeTicketCreated(
    uint256 indexed tokenId,
    uint256 indexed orderId,
    address indexed vendor,
    string serviceName
)
```

### Contract Logic Flow

#### For Free Tickets (amount = 0):
1. ✅ Vendor whitelist check still applies
2. ✅ NFT ticket is minted normally
3. ✅ Booking record is created
4. ❌ No token transfer to vendor
5. ❌ No token transfer from buyer
6. ❌ No platform fee charged
7. ✅ `FreeTicketCreated` event emitted

#### For Paid Tickets (amount > 0):
1. ✅ All existing functionality preserved
2. ✅ Token transfers occur as before
3. ✅ Platform fees calculated and charged
4. ✅ `TicketMinted` event emitted

## Frontend Integration

### Contract Client Updates

The contract client has been updated with new functions:

```typescript
// Check if a ticket is free
export async function isFreeTicket(tokenId: bigint): Promise<boolean>

// Updated ABI includes free ticket support
const UNILABOOK_ABI = parseAbi([
  // ... existing functions
  "function isFreeTicket(uint256 tokenId) view returns (bool)",
  "event FreeTicketCreated(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 indexed orderId, address indexed vendor, string serviceName)"
])
```

### UI Considerations

#### Ticket Display
- Free tickets should be clearly marked as "FREE" or "COMPLIMENTARY"
- Different styling/colors for free vs paid tickets
- Show "No payment required" instead of price

#### Order Creation
- Allow vendors to set price to 0
- Show clear indication when creating free listings
- Handle mixed orders (some free, some paid)

#### Verification Process
- Free tickets still require verification
- Same QR code and NFT verification process
- Clear indication in verification UI

## Use Cases

### Promotional Events
- Free workshops and seminars
- Complimentary trial services
- Marketing events and demos

### Educational Content
- Free educational workshops
- Community events
- Training sessions

### Vendor Benefits
- Attract customers with free offerings
- Build customer base
- Promote paid services

### Platform Benefits
- Increased user engagement
- More vendor participation
- Broader service offerings

## Implementation Examples

### Creating a Free Ticket Order

```typescript
const vendorPayments = [
  {
    vendor: "0x...", // Vendor address
    amount: 0, // Free ticket
    isPaid: false
  }
];

const serviceNames = ["Free Workshop"];
const bookingDates = [Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 86400];
const metadata = JSON.stringify({
  type: "free_ticket",
  description: "Complimentary workshop"
});

// Create order - no token approval needed for free tickets
const orderId = await createOrder(
  vendorPayments,
  serviceNames,
  bookingDates,
  metadata
);
```

### Checking if Ticket is Free

```typescript
const tokenId = BigInt(123);
const isFree = await isFreeTicket(tokenId);

if (isFree) {
  console.log("This is a free ticket");
  // Show free ticket UI
} else {
  console.log("This is a paid ticket");
  // Show paid ticket UI
}
```

### Mixed Order (Free + Paid)

```typescript
const vendorPayments = [
  {
    vendor: vendor1Address,
    amount: 0, // Free workshop
    isPaid: false
  },
  {
    vendor: vendor2Address,
    amount: ethers.parseEther("50"), // Paid course
    isPaid: false
  }
];

// Only need token approval for the paid portion
const totalPaidAmount = ethers.parseEther("50");
// ... rest of order creation
```

## Security Considerations

### Whitelist Requirements
- **Free tickets still require vendor whitelist**
- This prevents unauthorized vendors from issuing tickets
- Maintains platform security and trust

### No Payment Bypass
- Free tickets don't bypass any security checks
- Same verification process as paid tickets
- Same NFT minting and tracking

### Event Tracking
- All free tickets are tracked via `FreeTicketCreated` events
- Full audit trail maintained
- Analytics and reporting supported

## Testing

### Test Script
A test script has been created to verify free ticket functionality:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/test-free-tickets.js
```

### Test Cases
1. ✅ Create order with amount = 0
2. ✅ Verify no token transfer occurs
3. ✅ Verify NFT is still minted
4. ✅ Verify vendor whitelist check applies
5. ✅ Verify `FreeTicketCreated` event is emitted
6. ✅ Verify `isFreeTicket()` returns true
7. ✅ Test mixed orders (free + paid)

## Migration Notes

### Existing Contracts
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- All paid ticket logic remains unchanged
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Database Updates
- No database schema changes required
- Existing booking records work with amount = 0
- Order records support totalAmount = 0

### Frontend Updates
- Update UI to handle amount = 0
- Add free ticket indicators
- Update order creation forms

## Best Practices

### For Vendors
